/**
 * Role-based access checks. Pure and project-agnostic: the permission data is
 * always passed in, so this module knows nothing about the roles, permissions
 * or routes of any particular app. See `~/config/permissions` for the data.
 *
 * Deny by default, and it falls out of the data rather than being bolted on: a
 * role holds exactly the permissions granted to it, so a role the frontend has
 * never heard of resolves to no grants at all and is denied without a single
 * special case. There is no "unrestricted" value to get wrong.
 *
 * This module answers questions; it does not enforce anything. Enforcement is
 * `event.context.requirePermission` for endpoints (`server/utils/guard.ts`) and
 * the global route middleware for pages (`app/middleware/auth.global.ts`).
